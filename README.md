# Lung Cancer Detection with Federated Learning Algorithms & ResNet Model

(Most of the data can be found directly in the Lung_Cancer_Detection code .)

Project Overview:
This repository houses a comprehensive lung cancer detection framework developed using deep learning models and federated learning algorithms. The project utilizes Python, Keras, TensorFlow, and Kaggle's LIDC dataset to facilitate lung cancer detection.

# Non-Federated Learning Models:
In this project, various non-federated learning models such as Regularized CNN, ResNet152V2, VIT, VGG19, EfficientNetB7 and BiLSTM CNN are employed to classify images for lung cancer detection. The repository includes detailed architecture diagrams, evaluation metrics (loss, accuracy, recall, precision, AUC), and performance data for each model along with plots for data visualisation.

# Federated Learning Models:
Additionally, the project explores federated learning algorithms, including Federated Average, Federated Proximal, and Federated Adagrad, for lung cancer detection. Evaluation metrics are employed to compare the performance of federated learning models with non-federated counterparts. The analysis includes client accuracy and loss plots over communication rounds, providing insights into model performance and scalability and plots for data visualisation.

All of the above can be found in the code that has been provided in the repository.

Project Workflow:

1) Research and Topic Exploration: Extensive research was conducted to understand the topic and identify suitable datasets. The LIDC dataset from Kaggle was selected for its relevance to lung cancer detection.
2) Input/Output Setup: A robust setup for input/output handling was established, including preliminary analysis of input images.
3) Development of Non-Federated Learning Models: Multiple pre-built deep learning models were adapted (from Kaggle) and fine-tuned using TensorFlow and Keras, the models were specialised according to the needs. Evaluation was conducted using various metrics and visualization techniques.
4) Development of Federated Learning Models: Three federated learning models were developed based on Federated Average, Federated Proximal, and Federated Adagrad algorithms. Similar evaluation metrics were applied, and client-specific analysis was performed.
5) Comparison Between FL and Non-FL Models: A systematic comparison was made between the best-performing non-federated model (ResNet152V2) and the best-performing federated learning model (Federated Adagrad). Performance metrics, including loss and accuracy, were analyzed, and visualizations were created for comprehensive comparison.

Project Duration:
This project spanned over three months and required extensive research, development, and evaluation.

Conclusion:
This project was a great & enriching learning experience, providing valuable insights into the realms of AI, ML, and DL models. It also serves as a testament to my commitment and determination to continuous learning and exploration in the field of artificial intelligence.
